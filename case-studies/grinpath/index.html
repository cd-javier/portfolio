                    <h3>the brief</h3>
                    <p>
                        Working on Grinpath was all about building a comprehensive solution for women with fibromyalgia.
                        In just 10 days, alongside Beth Mac and Curtis Ross, we helped transform their MedTech
                        app—designed to offer personalised behavioural activation and a gamified community—for a target
                        audience of women aged 25 to 45. Our mission? Enhance quality of life and empower users by
                        combining smart tech with genuine care.
                    </p>

                    <h3>the challenge</h3>
                    <p>
                        Grinpath’s founders had poured years into refining every feature, but they were so immersed that
                        they lost sight of what users truly needed. When we first dove into the beta, we felt lost
                        navigating its complex structure. Users, too, would struggle to access the valuable resources
                        designed to support them. The app needed a radical rethink of its information architecture and
                        user flow, ensuring that every interaction felt personal and empowering.

                <h2>our assumptions</h2>
                <div class="text-body">
                    <p>
                        Right from the kickoff with Ale, Grinpath’s CTO, we laid out our assumptions to steer our
                        research:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Users crave personalized information that feels tailored to them.</li>
                        <li>Real motivation comes when goals link to daily life.</li>
                        <li>Users are more driven when they set their own goals.</li>
                        <li>A lack of motivation (rather than a lack of desire) is the main barrier to treatment
                            progress.</li>
                        <li>Women over 45 are less likely to engage with an app designed for pain management.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="text-body">
                    <p>
                        To validate our assumptions and truly understand our target users, we took a two-pronged
                        approach.
                    </p>

                    <h3>secondary research</h3>
                    <p>
                        We dove into the digital world of fibromyalgia—reviewing online forums, social media chatter,
                        and industry articles. Through this deep dive, we discovered that many women face misdiagnoses
                        and a pervasive distrust of conventional medical advice. The complexity and variability of
                        fibromyalgia symptoms underscore the urgent need for a supportive, user-friendly resource.
                    </p>

                    <h3>primary research</h3>
                    <p>
                        The real breakthrough came when we managed to interview several women living with chronic pain.
                        Given the challenges of securing participants for such a sensitive topic, each conversation was
                        gold. These interviews revealed that users aren’t lacking motivation—they’re craving genuine
                        support and understanding. Their primary goal? To reclaim their quality of life so they can be
                        present for their loved ones. They also expressed a deep desire for a community that offers
                        empathy, shared experiences, and even a touch of humor—a stark contrast to the negative cycles
                        common in many existing forums. </p>

                    <p>
                        From these rich conversations, we synthesised our insights into a single, well-defined persona:
                        Linda.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In UX design, a user persona is a fictional character that embodies the common traits,
                        challenges, and aspirations of your target audience. Linda isn’t a real person, but her profile
                        represents the typical experience of our users—struggling with isolation, chronic pain, and an
                        overwhelming need for empathy and support.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Using Linda as our guiding light, every design decision was made with her needs in mind.

Linda, a 40-year-old bank assistant from Inverness with a university education who uses a mobile, laptop, and tablet, was misdiagnosed for a decade before receiving a fibromyalgia diagnosis. She manages her pain through exercise and diet to avoid the side effects of prescribed painkillers. Her goals are to improve her quality of life, achieve physical and mental well-being, and spend more quality time with her family. Her frustrations include difficulty finding positive communities, the impact of her pain on daily activities, symptom fluctuations (such as those caused by the weather), and others’ misunderstandings of her condition. Her needs center on daily pain management, feeling supported, and connecting with others who share her experience"

                    <p>
                        To further ground our design choices, we mapped out Linda’s journey. This exercise uncovered
                        critical pain points—from moments of deep frustration to flashes of hope when she accessed a
                        helpful resource. By turning these pain points into “How Might We…” opportunities, we reimagined
                        a user experience that supports, empowers, and uplifts.

                        Armed with our research, we brainstormed ideas and prioritised them using the MOSCOW method. The
                        must-haves quickly emerged:

                    <p>
                        For our MVP, we focused on a transformative flow: when Linda is in pain, she taps an “I’m in
                        pain” button and is presented with either a curated library of pain relief resources or an
                        invitation to join a supportive community.

The flow concludes with community participation and a reward for successful distraction"

                    <p>
                        After testing over 30 colour options, we settled on a soothing triad palette that exudes support
                        and trust while keeping a playful edge.

                    <p>
                        For typography, we kept Grinpath’s Barlow for bodies of text, but opted for Asap for headings, a
                        typeface that injects a bit of fun without losing its reliability.

                        The final hi-fi prototype was built around two core paths
                    </p>

                    <h3>primary path</h3>
                    <p>
                        This path is based on our user flow, which focuses on providing immediate pain relief resources.
                        This approach prioritizes simplicity, featuring prominent buttons and minimal options. Our goal
                        is to ensure that Linda can quickly and easily access the help she needs when experiencing pain.
                    </p>

                        Alternatively users can also explore Grinpath's personalised behavioural activation program.
                        They have the option to view it as a map, allowing them to visualize their progress and future
                        goals, or in a list view for a more straightforward approach, catering to users who prefer a
                        non-game format.

                        Time was tight, so we focused on delivering the MVP. Looking ahead, Grinpath envisions expanding
                        the community space with a dedicated venting section, introducing a mentor system pairing
                        experienced users with newcomers, and enhancing the behavioural activation program through
                        closer collaboration with their medical team.

                    <p>
                        Reflecting on the project, securing interview participants was challenging and stretched our
                        timeline—but every challenge taught us something invaluable. Given more time, I’d have loved to
                        refine the hi-fi details even further. Working with Beth and Curtis was a true delight; their
                        deep passion for UX pushed me to always strive for excellence.
