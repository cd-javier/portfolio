                    <h3>Client</h3>
                    <p>In the competitive world of online dating apps, niche platforms like LESGO are key for addressing
                        the needs of underrepresented communities. LESGO, an Australian LGBTQIA+ dating app, stands out
                        with its unique feature that allows users to seamlessly toggle between swiping modes:
                        friendship, dating, or casual encounters.</p>
                    <p>
                        As LESGO prepared to expand into the UK market, the need for a design update was clear—to appeal
                        to a new demographic, enhance the user experience, and adhere to accessibility standards.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        The initial assessment of LESGO revealed a product with a lot of potential, created with heart
                        and the best of intentions, but that lacked the design input of a UX professional. As often
                        happens in small companies with tight budgets, where the stakeholder doubles as the UI designer,
                        the perspective of the end user can sometimes be lost, resulting in usability and accessibility
                        issues, an unintuitive information architecture, and a general non-cohesive design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, we embarked on what we playfully called a ‘facelift’, aiming not only to update and
                        modernise the aesthetics but also to streamline and simplify interactions. In this case study,
                        I’ll explore how we transformed LESGO through a user-centred design approach.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Goal</h3>
                    <p>
                        Modernise the visual design, resolve accessibility issues, and restructure the app’s interface
                        to improve user engagement.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section-wrapper">
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Visual Identity</h2>
                <div class="text-body">
                    <h3>First Assessment</h3>
                    <p>In its first iteration, the LESGO app presented a visual experience that was dated and
                        inconsistent. The original design featured a range of mismatched colours and gradients,
                        inconsistent icon styles and emojis, and a layout that while trying to be original and
                        groundbreaking, did not meet the standard of modern app aesthetics.</p>

                    <p>Our primary goal for the visual redesign was to create a cohesive and modern look that would
                        resonate with its target audience and stand out from other similar apps. We aimed for a
                        welcoming and vibrant interface, with a unified colour palette and consistent design elements.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <img src="/assets/img/case-studies/lesgo/02-aesthetic.png" alt="" class="case-study-img">

                <div class="text-body">
                    <h3>Colour Scheme</h3>
                    <p>Originally, LESGO’s colour scheme was tame, almost scared to make a bold move. We shook things up
                        by choosing a palette that aligns with the brand’s identity. We kept LESGO’s signature blue as
                        the primary colour, with tones of off-white and off-black for background and text elements. By
                        using gradients that differ from pure black and white, we minimise eye strain and boost
                        accessibility.</p>

                    <p>This combination of colours makes LESGO stand out from its competitors while being subtle enough
                        that the user wouldn’t be scared to open the app in public.</p>
                </div>

                <img src="/assets/img/case-studies/lesgo/03-palette.png" alt="" class="case-study-img"

                <div class="text-body">
                    <h3>Corners</h3>
                    <p>In its earlier design, LESGO opted for varying degrees of rounded edges for different elements,
                        resulting in an antiquated style that lacked uniformity.</p>

                    <p>We decided to listen to what the design organically asked for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Square design with a subtle 4px radius on most elements.</li>
                        <li>16px radius to soften deck swipe cards.</li>
                        <li>Fully round corners on elements that benefited from it.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This approach standardised our design and refreshed the overall feel of the interface.</p>
                </div>

                <img src="/assets/img/case-studies/lesgo/04-corner-radius.png" alt="" class="case-study-img"
                    style="max-height: 350px">

                <div class="text-body">
                    <h3>Typography</h3>
                    <p>Without changing the original typography, we standardised the style throughout the app, keeping a
                        bold style for titles, and keeping italics only when naming the app.</p>

                    <h3>Iconography</h3>
                    <p>Previously, the app’s icons varied in style and were often presented as emojis. We introduced a
                        new set of icons, intuitive and uniform, each carefully selected to convey its function and be
                        instantly recognisable.</p>
                </div>

                <img src="/assets/img/case-studies/lesgo/05-iconography.png" alt="" class="case-study-img"

                <div class="text-body">
                    <h3>Layout</h3>
                    <p>In terms of layout, we reconfigured the app’s structure to better reflect the mental models of
                        our users. We focused on intuitive navigation and a logical organisation of elements, which we
                        will explore in more detail in the following section. </p>
                </div>

                <h2>Navigation</h2>

                <div class="text-body">
                    <h3>Challenges with the original design.</h3>
                    <p>Originally, LESGO had opted for a minimalist approach without a traditional navigation bar. While
                        this decision seems to maximise screen real estate and keep a simple and clean design, this
                        didn’t translate well in practice.</p>

                    <p>This format can be effective in apps focused on a single function, like Deliveroo or Citymapper,
                        while on LESGO it led to a confusing user interface, crowded with similar-looking buttons that
                        lacked intuitive navigation cues.</p>
                </div>

                <img src="/assets/img/case-studies/lesgo/06-navigation.png" alt="" class="case-study-img"
                    style="max-height: 500px">

                <div class="text-body">
                    <h3>Redesign Strategy</h3>
                    <p>To address these issues, we realigned our design more closely with our users’ mental models. We
                        introduced a simple but effective navigation bar that organically divides the app into four main
                        sections: Home, Messages, Explore, and Profile and Settings.</p>

                    <p>This streamlined navigation does not just simplify the interface, it also sets the groundwork for
                        future updates. Buy establishing a clear modular navigation, we create a space that can easily
                        accommodate new features as LESGO continues to evolve.</p>

                <h2>User Testing</h2>
                <div class="text-body">
                    <p>To ensure our design decisions were on the right track, we conducted a series of user tests with
                        a group of participants from our target audience. These tests aimed to confirm our design
                        improvements and address questions we had during the redesign process.</p>

                    <p>Some of the specifics we focused on were:</p>

                    <h3>Understanding Swiping Modes</h3>
                    <p>A key area of our focus was whether users would understand the distinct swiping modes
                        (friendship, dating, casual encounters). The test results indicated that the clear labels and
                        intuitive icons made it easy for users to identify and distinguish between the modes.</p>

                    <h3>Navigating to Settings</h3>
                    <p>We were concerned about whether users could easily find their settings with the new navigation
                        bar. Feedback showed that users could quickly locate and access their settings, confirming the
                        effectiveness of our streamlined navigation.</p>

                    <h3>Explore Section Icon</h3>
                    <p>The Explore section of the app serves as a magazine with city-specific articles about queer
                        lifestyle. We initially struggled to find an appropriate icon, and testing helped us choose the
                        current magazine icon. We had previously tried a globe and a magnifying glass, but our users’
                        mental models led them to interpret these icons as referring to different features already
                        existing in other apps.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section-wrapper">
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Review & Preview</h2>
                <div class="text-body">
                    <p>Reflecting on the feedback from our user testing, we are confident that our 'facelift' has
                        significantly enhanced the overall user experience. Users reported a more intuitive and visually
                        appealing interface, aligning perfectly with our initial goals for the redesign. This positive
                        outcome has not only validated our efforts but also inspired us to continue innovating.</p>

                    <p>We have designed new features that we believe will be game-changers for the queer app landscape.
                        Here’s a teaser of some of them:</p>
                    <h3>Safety Beacon</h3>
                    <p>We know that it’s not uncommon for queer people to feel unsafe when meeting someone from an app.
                        To address this concern, we have created the Safety Beacon. With just a couple of taps, users
                        can send their real-time location to a trusted contact in they find themselves in a risky
                        situation.</p>

                </div>

                    style="max-height:500px">

                <div class="text-body">
                    <h3>Events Calendar</h3>
                    <p>Navigating multiple websites to find LGBTQ+ friendly events can be a hassle. That’s why we’ve
                        created a one-stop events calendar that consolidates all queer events into a single, easy-to-use
                        platform.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>Ever wanted to attend an event but couldn’t find anyone to go with? Our +1 feature solves this by
                        using swiping cards to help users find companions for nights out, theatre shows, or even house
                        parties.
