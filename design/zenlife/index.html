                    <h3>the brief</h3>
                    <p>
                        I teamed up with a startup in the wellness industry to transform ZenLife—a beta app that offers
                        eastern wellness practices like yoga, meditation, and kung-fu—into an intuitive, user-friendly
                        experience. With just 10 days on the clock, my goal was to cut through the clutter and make the
                        app feel as inviting and clear as the mindful practices it celebrates.
                    </p>

                    <h3>the challenge</h3>
                    <p>
                        ZenLife had been built with passion, but the founders were so immersed in perfecting every
                        detail that they lost sight of the user’s perspective. When I first explored the beta, I found
                        myself wandering through confusing menus and complex features—if I could get lost, so would the
                        users. It was clear: the app needed a major usability tweak, starting with a fresh information
                        architecture and a clearer design approach.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section-wrapper">
            <div class="section">
                <h2>our approach</h2>
                <div class="text-body">
                    <p>
                        I started with a “hands-on user testing session.” I treated my first interaction with ZenLife as
                        a genuine exploration, mapping out features and screens without any preconceived notions. From
                        there, I zeroed in on one of the most critical aspects: the information architecture.
                    </p>

                    <h3>information architecture refresh</h3>

                    <p>
                        I began by sketching the app’s initial sitemap, which felt cluttered and overwhelming.
                    </p>

                <div class="text-body">
                    <p>
                        After researching best practices and analysing similar apps, I restructured the sitemap into a
                        more intuitive, user-friendly flow.
                    </p>

                <h2>redesign</h2>
                <div class="text-body">
                    <p>
                        I iterated through a series of designs—moving from low-fidelity sketches to polished hi-fi
                        screens—to breathe clarity and purpose into every key area of the app.
                    </p>

                    <h3>homepage</h3>
                    <p>
                        The homepage is the dashboard of ZenLife—it needs to provide a snapshot of your profile,
                        calendar, and notifications at a glance. In the original design, news dominated the space while
                        essential features were shoved into a secondary carousel. I flipped that around, giving key
                        functions prime real estate and relegating news to its own dedicated page.
                    </p>

                <div class="text-body">
                    <h3>news</h3>
                    <p>
                        The news section now lives on a separate screen with a clear hierarchy: the latest article grabs
                        your attention first, and once read, it fades out to keep the focus on what’s new.

                    <p>
                        Since wellness is the heart of ZenLife, I merged what were once separate “Videos” and “Wellness
                        Services” into one cohesive Wellness section. It’s now organised into:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Live</b>: showing current and upcoming livestreams.</li>
                        <li><b>Wellness Programs</b>: complete with brief explanations to help users distinguish between
                            different content types.</li>
                        <li><b>Your Library</b>: a dedicated space for your own lessons.</li>
                        <li><b>Purchase More Classes</b>: making it easy to expand your learning. I crafted a seamless,
                            engaging flow for this section so that every wellness experience feels natural.</li>
                    </ul>

                    alt="Two mobile screenshots of the ZenLife wellness interface.

                    class="case-study-img" style="max-height: 450px;">

                <div class="text-body">
                    <p>
                        I added a brief explanation of the various sections within the Wellness Programs. This will
                        allow users to make informed choices based on the information provided within the app, without
                        the need for external research that might divert their attention away from the app.

The third one, labeled 'high fidelity', looks exactly like the second one but colours and images have been added."

                    <p>
                        Originally, ZenLife featured a “Menu” with a hamburger icon that lumped together settings and
                        other items—confusing and counterintuitive. I rebranded this as “Settings” and tucked it neatly
                        into the profile. This change not only declutters the navbar but also mirrors familiar patterns
                        seen in apps like Instagram and TikTok, making it easier for users to find what they need.
                    </p>

There's an arrow at the bottom left pointing at the navbar: 'simpler navbar', one on the bottom right: 'room for upcoming features', and one on the top right, pointing at a settings icon 'intuitive placement for users. As seen on: Instagram, TikTok, Tumblr, BeReal'"

                    <p>
                        I divided the settings page into sections, making it easier for the user to quickly scan the
                        screen and find what they're looking for.

The third screen, labeled 'high- fidelity', looks the same as the second but it follows the app's colour palette and icons."

                        Convincing the client to embrace these changes wasn’t easy, but data-backed user testing made it
                        undeniable. This project reinforced that while deep expertise is essential, keeping the user
                        front and center is what truly drives a great experience. A refreshed information architecture
                        paired with iterative, user-focused design not only simplifies the app—it elevates it.
